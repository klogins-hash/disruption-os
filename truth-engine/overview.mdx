## The Problem

**Standard AI is sycophantic.** ChatGPT and Claude want to be "helpful," so they validate bad ideas.

<Warning>
Sycophantic AI leads to expensive mistakes
</Warning>

## The Solution

An **Adversarial "Red Team" Architecture** that forces honest analysis.

## How It Works

<CodeGroup>
```text Agent A: The Hype Man
Role: Argues for the UPSIDE
Goal: Find every possible success path
Output: Bull case with citations
```

```text Agent B: The Assassin  
Role: Argues for FAILURE MODE
Goal: Find every way it dies
Output: Bear case with citations
Constraint: "Citation or Silence"
```

```text The Constraint
Rule: Cannot claim competitor exists without URL
Result: Only real threats, no hallucinations
```
</CodeGroup>

<Check>
Truth emerges from adversarial debate, not consensus
</Check>
