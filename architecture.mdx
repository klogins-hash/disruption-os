## The "Truth Engine" Architecture

**The Problem:** Standard AI (ChatGPT/Claude) is sycophantic. It wants to be "helpful," so it lies and validates bad ideas.

**The Solution:** An Adversarial "Red Team" Architecture.

### The Protocol

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agent A: The Hype Man">
    Argues for the Upside
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent B: The Assassin">
    Argues for the Failure Mode
  </Step>
  <Step title="The Constraint">
    "Citation or Silence" - Agents cannot claim a competitor exists without a URL
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Hybrid Data Model

To solve the "Privacy Paradox" (VCs not wanting to share data), we use an 80/20 split.

### The 80% Layer: "Known Knowns" (Public Logic)

The system is pre-trained on undeniable truths:

1. **Demographics:** Boomers are retiring (Labor shortage)
2. **Moats:** Intelligence is free; Context is king
3. **AGI Horizon:** Reasoning costs are dropping to zero

### The 20% Layer: "Private Penthouse" (VC Specific)

- VCs have a private silo
- Their deals are checked against the "Known Knowns"
- Their data never leaves their instance
